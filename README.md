# CodecademyPortfolio

## Welcome to my first public repository. This is one of the tasks from Codecademy - Front-end Developer Path.

Retro Computer Style Porfolio using pure CSS only! No single image was used for this project!

### Technolgies:
- **Html5:** I was trying to stay as semantic as I could (due to specific UI/overall design). Easy send e-mail form (no JS).
- **CSS:** Flex, Grid, media queries, advanced box-shadows, transitions, scroll-snap, custom scrollbar
- **JavaScript:** EventListeners for "scrolling keys" (mousedown, mouseup, mouseout - with some intervals), 
- **Figma:** basic mockup, font tests
- **Git/Github:** first time using GIT and Github (public repo)

### To DO's:
- add touch support for mobile
- fix mobile view (I forgot about the URL bar)
- better code organization
- fix custom scroll white square bug
- fix mobile landscape orientation bug
